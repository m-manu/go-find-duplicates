## Introduction

A blazingly-fast simple-to-use tool to find duplicate files (photos, videos, music, documents etc.) on your computer,
portable hard drives etc.

**Note**:

* This tool just *reads* your files and creates a 'duplicates report' file
* It does **not** delete or otherwise modify your files in any way üôÇ
* So, it's very safe to use üëç

## How to install?

1. Install Go version at least **1.22**
    * See: [Go installation instructions](https://go.dev/doc/install)
2. Run command:
   ```bash
   go install github.com/m-manu/go-find-duplicates@latest
   ```
3. Add following line in your `.bashrc`/`.zshrc` file:
   ```bash
   export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/go/bin"
   ```

## How to use?

### Run directly (preferred)

```bash
go-find-duplicates {dir-1} {dir-2} ... {dir-n}
```

### Command line options

Running `go-find-duplicates --help` displays following:

```
go-find-duplicates is a tool to find duplicate files and directories

Usage:
  go-find-duplicates [flags] <dir-1> <dir-2> ... <dir-n>

where,
  arguments are readable directories that need to be scanned for duplicates

Flags (all optional):
  -x, --exclusions string   path to file containing newline-separated list of file/directory names to be excluded
                            (if this is not set, by default these will be ignored:
                            .DS_Store, System Volume Information, $RECYCLE.BIN etc.)
  -h, --help                display help
  -m, --minsize uint        minimum size of file in KiB to consider (default 4)
  -o, --output string       following modes are accepted:
                             text = creates a text file in current directory with basic information
                              csv = creates a csv file in current directory with detailed information
                            print = just prints the report without creating any file
                             json = creates a JSON file in the current directory with basic information
                             (default "text")
  -p, --parallelism uint8   extent of parallelism (defaults to number of cores minus 1)
  -t, --thorough            apply thorough check of uniqueness of files
                            (caution: this makes the scan very slow!)
      --version             Display version (1.6.0) and exit (useful for incorporating this in scripts)

```

### Run via Docker

```bash
docker run --rm -v /Volumes/PortableHD:/mnt/PortableHD manumk/go-find-duplicates:latest go-find-duplicates -o print /mnt/PortableHD
```

In above command:

* option `--rm` removes the container when it exits
* option `-v` is mounts host directory `/Volumes/PortableHD` as `/mnt/PortableHD` inside the container

## How does this identify duplicates?

**By default**, this tool identifies duplicates if _all_ of the following conditions match:

1. file extension is same
2. file size is same
3. CRC32 hash of "crucial bytes" is same

If above default isn't enough for your requirements, you could use the command line option `--thorough` to switch to
SHA-256 hash of *entire file contents*. But remember, with this, scan becomes much slower!

When tested on my portable hard drive containing >172k files (videos, audio files, images and documents), with and
without `--thorough` option, the results were same!

## How to build?

```shell
go build 
```
